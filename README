This project's main idea is from the assignment in CS 246 of University of Waterloo.

Straights is the card game which plays with 52 trump cards without jokers. This program requires 4 players in total. It provides the function of following:

1. We can set who is computer player among 4 players. When the computer player's turn comes, then the program will play the card on its own. 
2. The function rage quit enables the computer player takes place of the human player. 
3. Wrong commands triggers program to print "wrong command" on the text display.
